## refactored with an ant class and multiple ants


I have refactored the code to be object oriented with an Ant() class

The ants can leave a symbol in the array.  For two ants this is a 1 or a 2

when the antworld array is displayed in the sketch colors are added.

two ants can create an ant oscillation that is pretty cool.

refreshing the browser page sets the ants in a random place

you can keep trying till you see it.
